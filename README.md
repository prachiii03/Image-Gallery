Responsive Design: The gallery is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.
Interactive Features: Includes keyboard navigation and hover effects for an enhanced user experience.
Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure for the gallery.
CSS: Used for styling the gallery and ensuring a responsive design.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the gallery.
